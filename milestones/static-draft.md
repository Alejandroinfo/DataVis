## What is your current goal? Has it changed since the proposal?
My current goal is to try to understand better what kind of crimes are happening and when they are happening. As well
as if there is some way to help people.

## Are there data challenges you are facing? Are you currently depending on mock data?
So far the data has in this year has been very useful it might look hard to find more specific data about gang related crimes and the location of these places. It would potentially good to discern gang and non gang crimes comitted but it is going to be hard to get that info.

## Describe each of the provided images with 2-3 sentences to give the context and how it relates to your goal.
